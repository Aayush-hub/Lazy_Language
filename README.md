# Lazy Language: A better language than JAVA, C++, Python, C, C#, Ruby, Swift, Haskel, Pascal and English! (JK)

This project is a langauge interpreter that is capable of running one line code on shell and compile whole file.
This language interpreter only supports ".lca" file which means LazyCoderr + Arpit.

THIS IS NOT A REAL LANGUAGE. IT IS JUST A SMALL PROTOTYPE OF HOW REAL INTERPRETERS WORK!

Grammar of this can be found in Grammar.txt

# How to use
1. Clone this repository
2. Run "python main.py arpit.lca" to run sample code file
3. Run "python main.py" to open shell and code directly on shell
4. Run "quit()" to exit from shell
4. Documentation will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned!
